/**
 * Provenance of a resource is a record that describes entities and processes involved in producing
 * and delivering or otherwise influencing that resource. Provenance provides a critical foundation
 * for assessing authenticity, enabling trust, and allowing reproducibility. Provenance assertions
 * are a form of contextual metadata and can themselves become important records with their own
 * provenance. Provenance statement indicates clinical significance in terms of confidence in
 * authenticity, reliability, and trustworthiness, integrity, and stage in lifecycle (e.g. Document
 * Completion - has the artifact been legally authenticated), all of which may impact security,
 * privacy, and trust policies.
