/**
 * A record of a medication that is being consumed by a patient.   A MedicationStatement may indicate
 * that the patient may be taking the medication now or has taken the medication in the past or will
 * be taking the medication in the future.  The source of this information can be the patient,
 * significant other (such as a family member or spouse), or a clinician.  A common scenario where
 * this information is captured is during the history taking process during a patient visit or stay.
 * The medication information may come from sources such as the patient's memory, from a prescription
 * bottle,  or from a list of medications the patient, clinician or other party maintains.
 * 
 * The primary difference between a medication statement and a medication administration is that the
 * medication administration has complete administration information and is based on actual
 * administration information from the person who administered the medication.  A medication
 * statement is often, if not always, less specific.  There is no required date/time when the
 * medication was administered, in fact we only know that a source has reported the patient is taking
 * this medication, where details such as time, quantity, or rate or even medication product may be
 * incomplete or missing or less precise.  As stated earlier, the medication statement information
 * may come from the patient's memory, from a prescription bottle or from a list of medications the
 * patient, clinician or other party maintains.  Medication administration is more formal and is not
 * missing detailed information.
